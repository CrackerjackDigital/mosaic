# mosaic
mosaic layout engine and front-end libraries/tools.

Mosaic uses other components from e.g. Rob Loache's excellent component suite on packagist, as well as some straight
from github. These are (should be) regularly updated by running composer against the components.json file in package root
which will install to mosaic/components/ directory for loading/inclusing in requirements. There is also the standard
composer.json for including mosaic itself.
